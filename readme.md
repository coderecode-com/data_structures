# Data Structures in Python

Python, a versatile and powerful programming language, offers a rich set of built-in data structures that are both
intuitive and efficient. These data structures form the building blocks for designing more complex data structures and
algorithms, and they play a pivotal role in enhancing the efficiency of Python programs. Whether you're dealing with
data storage, retrieval, or manipulation, understanding Python's data structures is crucial for any aspiring Python
developer.

## [Big O](/big_o)

Big O notation describes the upper limit of an algorithm's runtime as the size of its input grows.

## Common Data Structures in Python

### Lists

A dynamic array that can store elements of any type. It supports indexing, slicing, and various methods to manipulate
the data.

### Tuples

Similar to a list but immutable. Once you create a tuple, you cannot alter its contents.

### Sets

An unordered collection of unique elements. Useful for membership tests and eliminating duplicate entries.

### Dictionaries (Dicts)

An unordered collection of key-value pairs. It allows you to store and retrieve data based on a key.

### Deques

A double-ended queue that supports adding and removing elements from both ends in O(1) time.

### [Stacks](/stacks)

A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. Python doesn't have a built-in stack, but it can be easily implemented using
lists or `collections.deque`.

### Queues

A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. Python's `queue` module provides several implementations, including `Queue`
, `LifoQueue`, and `PriorityQueue`.
