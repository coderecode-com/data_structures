# Big O Notation Overview

## Introduction

- Represents the **upper limit** or **worst case** of an algorithm's runtime.
- Used to gauge **efficiency** as input size grows.

## Time Complexity vs Space Complexity

- Time complexity answers how long does it take
- Space complexity answers how much memory does it need

## Common Big O Notations

- **O(1)**: Constant Time
    - Independent of input size.

- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic Time
    - Divides problem size each step.
- **O(n)**: Linear Time
    - Directly proportional to input size.
- **O(n log n)**: Linear Logarithmic Time
    - Common in optimized sorting algorithms.
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic Time
    - Often seen with nested loops.

## Importance

- Helps in **choosing algorithms** for tasks.
- Understand **performance limits**.
- Vital for large datasets.
